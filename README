Another one of my old quick-hack script to grab images from 
subreddits of interest.

Tested on Arch, ArchPi and Ubuntu.
Grabs from : Imgur , gyfcat, (tested).

Stores files at ~/.subreddit/subreddit_name

Needs: Python3.xx, PRAW and BeautifulSoup.

List of issues:
	- Make the dir path OS independent.
	- Avoid Wget and subprocess, grab using write functions.
	- Make a way to avoid junk message printed to screen.

TODO:
=====
	- Pass subreddit list from commandline
	- Pass store directory from commandline
